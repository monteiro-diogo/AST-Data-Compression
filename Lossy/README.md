## Lossy Compression Study

**Objective:**  
Evaluate various *lossy compression* methods on different types of data:

1. **Numerical functions (1D)** — `.txt` files containing signal samples  
2. **Music (1D)** — well-known audio file *(e.g., Beethoven's 5th Symphony)*  
3. **Images (2D)** — black & white *(and possibly color)* images
